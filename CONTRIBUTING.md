# Contributing to Mini QR

Thank you for your interest in contributing to the Mini QR project! Contributions from the community are welcome to help improve and enhance this tool.

You can work on existing issues or suggest new ones. You can also share your presets with the world by referring to [this section](#adding-new-presets).

Before you start, please take a moment to read through these guidelines.

## Contributing Guidelines

### Issue Assignment

- Always request to be assigned to an issue before working on it, especially during the Hacktoberfest period. This helps prevent conflicting and duplicate work.
- Comment on the issue you'd like to work on, asking to be assigned.
- Wait for [@lyqht](https://github.com/lyqht) to assign you before starting work.

### Reporting Bugs or Suggesting Improvements

- If you find a bug or want to suggest an improvement, please raise an issue.
- For bug reports, provide clear steps for reproduction.
- For improvement suggestions, include mockups if the change is UI-based.

## Getting Started

1. Fork the repository and clone it to your local machine.
2. Install the necessary dependencies by running `pnpm install`. If you don't have pnpm installed, you can install it by running `npm install -g pnpm`.
3. Start the development server by running `pnpm dev`.
4. Create a new branch for your contribution, preferably with a name related to the issue you're working on. e.g. `author/issue-description`.

### Codebase overview

The project is a Vite-powered Vue.js application with Tailwind CSS for styling. The main components are:

- `src/App.vue`: This is the entry point of the application. Different logic are separated by comment regions.
- `src/components/StyledQRCode.vue`: This component is used to render the QR code. However, note that the actual QR code output includes a wrapper around this component, which you can find by `id="qr-code-container"` in `src/App.vue`.

Don't touch the other components in `src/components/` as they are generated by radix-vue.

- Styles can be found in the style block in `src/App.vue`.
- Util functions are found in `src/utils/`.
- Presets are found in `src/utils/presets.ts`. For adding new presets, you can refer to the existing ones and fill in the necessary properties.
- Assets are found in `src/assets/`.

## Adding new presets

An easy way to add a new preset is to create the QR code on the website first, and then save the config. The config JSON file will look something like this:

```json
{
  "props": {
    "data": "https://github.com/lyqht/mini-qr"
    // other props...
  },
  "style": {
    // other styles...
  }
}
```

Combine "style" with the value of "props" in a new json.

```ts
const yourNewPreset = {
  data: 'https://github.com/lyqht/mini-qr',
  // other props...
  style: {
    // other styles...
  }
}
```

Then add it to the `allPresets` array in `src/utils/presets.ts`. New presets should always be added as the last item in the array.

You will then see your new preset in the Presets dropdown in the website.
